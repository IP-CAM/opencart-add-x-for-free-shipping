@tik Add $x for free shipping

Purpose
=======

This is a poweful upselling tool.

When the customer visits his/her shopping cart page, this extension adds the message "Only $x (+VAT) more to Free Shipping!" above their products, thus luring them to buy more in order to benefit from free shipping.

Because this is a vQmod, no core files are touched, and the changes should carry over to the next version.
